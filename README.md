## About
Letter Lasso is a simple, engaging word-guessing game designed for mobile devices. Players are tasked with guessing a secret word by suggesting letters one at a time, with a limited number of incorrect guesses allowed. The game ends either when the player successfully guesses the word or runs out of attempts.

## Current Features
- **Login**: The Login function is used to authenticate users before they can play the game. It allows users to sign in using their credentials. This ensures that each player’s progress, scores, and preferences are linked to a specific account. If the user is new, they can create a new account by signing up.
- **Letter Input System**: The Letter Input System allows players to input their guesses by selecting letters. Each letter they choose is either placed into the word if it is correct or counted as an incorrect guess. Players have a limited number of attempts, and incorrect guesses are shown visually with the “hangman” drawing progressing as attempts are used up.
- **User-Profile**: The User Profile section allows players to view and manage their personal information, such as username, levels unlocked etc. Players can also update their profile settings.
- **Difficulty Level**: The Difficulty Level functionality allows players to choose the level of difficulty for their game. Depending on the selected difficulty (e.g., Easy, Medium, Hard), the game adjusts the complexity of the words (e.g., shorter vs. longer words) and the number of allowed attempts.
- **Help/Instruction Sections**: A brief introduction to what Hangman is and how the game works, teaching the player the basic rules, how to guess letters, and the goal of the game, which is to guess the word before the hangman is fully drawn.
- **Settings**: The Settings page allows players to configure their preferences for gameplay, such as turning sounds on or off, enabling/disabling notifications, or adjusting display settings (like dark mode). Settings help players tailor their experience according to their preferences
